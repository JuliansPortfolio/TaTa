# Tata Virtual Internship with Forage
## Empowering Business with Effective Insights

## Objective
An Online retail store wants to review their data and get insights that would be valuable to the CEO and CMO of the company. In achieving this they had to construct tactical questions that will give them the expected results.

### Project Tasks
1. The CEO of the retail store is interested to view the time series of the revenue data for the year 2011 only. He would like to view granular data by looking into revenue for each month. The CEO is interested in viewing the seasonal trends and wants to dig deeper into why these trends occur. This analysis will be helpful for the CEO to forecast for the next year.
2. The CMO is interested in viewing the top 10 countries which are generating the highest revenue. Additionally, the CMO is also interested in viewing the quantity sold along with the revenue generated. The CMO does not want to have the United Kingdom in this visual.
3. The CMO of the online retail store wants to view the information on the top 10 customers by revenue. He is interested in a visual that shows the greatest revenue generating customer at the start and gradually declines to the lower revenue generating customers. The CMO wants to target the higher revenue generating customers and ensure that they remain satisfied with their products.
4. The CEO is looking to gain insights on the demand for their products. He wants to look at all countries and see which regions have the greatest demand for their products. Once the CEO gets an idea of the regions that have high demand, he will initiate an expansion strategy which will allow the company to target these areas and generate more business from these regions. He wants to view the entire data on a single view without the need to scroll or hover over the data points to identify the demand. There is no need to show data for the United Kingdom as the CEO is more interested in viewing the countries that have expansion opportunities.

### Data Source
Online Retail: The data used for this analysis was gotten from forage platform.

### Tools
- Power Query - Data Cleaning
- Power Bi - Data Visualization and Analysis

### Data Cleaning and Processing
The dataset consist of 44,999 rows with 8 columns. These columns description are as follows: Invoice No, Stock Code, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, Unit price, CustomerID and Country. In order to get valuable insights, we generated another column with title Revenue; makinmg it total of 9 columns.

### Data Visualization
Due to the fact that we really don't have much analysis to make, we proceeded to visualisation. The first visualization was on the revenue genearted in the year 2011 across various months, second part was on the revenue and quantity that belong to top 10 countries, third part was top 10 revenue contributed by customers and lastly, were top demand by countries. The visualizations are below for grasp and better understanding:

### Findings/Insights
    The month that yielded the highest revenue was October, 2011 with the figure $216,000. While the least revenue was generated on December, 2011at $46,000. 
    The rate of quantity produced determines the rate of outcome that is revenue. From our observation netherland, EIRE, Germany, France and Australia tops the chart with exclusive amounts. Spain, Switzerland, Belgium, Sweden and Japan came below. 
    Customer with the ID 14646 patronized massively when compared to other customers. Though some few customers with the ID: 14911, 12415 & 14156 also fall into loyal customers as a result of their unwaivering patronage.
    Most demand were carried out in North American region. This shows that majority of the c ustomers are Americans though North American precisely.

### Recommendation
1. There's a great need to improve sales in other low performing months. Also the company need to utilize the surge in revenue generation in October by add sale incentives like bonus, discount and so on.
2. Since most patronage are coming from 5 countries such as Netherland, EIRE, Germany, France and Australia the company need to ensure that customer satisfaction are being met by improving quality and quantity with unique brand.
3. Loyal customer are hard to come by due to human unquenching need. From our analysis we discovered 4 loyal customers which is not a good prospect for the growth of the company. Therefore, incentives should be incorporated in various format and in different state or region in order to boost sales.
4. Most demand were carried out in North American region. This shows that majority of the customers are Americans though North Americans precisely. On the part, regions like Europe, South America and Australia had little impact on demand. For efficient resource allocation and revenue generation more emphasis should be place on advertisement, sales promotion, direct selling and public relation at Europe, South America and Australia.
